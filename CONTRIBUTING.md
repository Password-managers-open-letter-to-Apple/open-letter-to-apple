### üõ° How do we prevent impersonation?

To reduce impersonation:
- **GitHub usernames** should ideally match real names or company accounts
- **Optional verification fields** (e.g. company domain email, LinkedIn profile, or company bio page) help us validate
- If we‚Äôre unsure, we may contact you at your official work domain for confirmation

We reserve the right to remove unverifiable or suspicious submissions.

Thank you for supporting an open, competitive password management ecosystem.
