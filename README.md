# An Open Letter to Apple: Let’s Make Password Management Better for Everyone

**January 28, 2025**

Dear Apple,

You’ve built robust password security in iOS. Yet by keeping essential OS-level password generation and credential AutoSave functionality exclusive to your new Passwords app, you missed an opportunity to strengthen the entire ecosystem.

These OS-level functionalities aren’t new to iOS 18, and they’ve long been restricted to iOS Keychain. However, users of third-party password managers face even greater obstacles now that you’ve automatically installed and enabled your Passwords app as the default AutoFill option for all users, regardless of their existing password manager preferences.

Here is how this creates security and usability barriers for users who rely on third-party password managers:

- **AutoSave**: Only the Passwords app can AutoSave credentials in Safari and iOS apps, while third-party apps are excluded from this essential OS-level functionality.
- **Password Generation**: The Passwords app utilizes the iOS password generator to prompt users to create strong passwords directly in apps and Safari. However, third-party password managers are denied access to this OS-level functionality, limiting their ability to provide this same seamless and secure user experience.

These restrictions appear particularly unnecessary when considering that Google has already proven this integration can be done safely. For example, Android successfully demonstrates that features like AutoSave can be securely implemented for third-party password managers without compromising the system’s security or requiring users to rely on a native solution.

## What We Urge Apple to Do

1. Grant third-party apps equal access to iOS password generator and credential AutoSave functionality.  
2. Work with the password management community, rather than against it, to enhance functionality and security for all iOS users.

An operating system should empower its users, not prioritize its creator’s apps. We are eager to work with Apple to ensure a secure, innovative, and user-friendly password management ecosystem for everyone.

Sincerely,  
**Password Manager Alliance**
